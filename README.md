# Virtual_Bookshell
Final project by Peony Langner, Riccardo Limiti, Lukasz Trzcinski 

RUN APP: 

https://virtual-bookshell.herokuapp.com

Project description

The website can crash during the sessions, because search amount is limited from API provider

We offer a catalogue of books (using API)

To search for books based on a keyword (e.g. bread - would get cooking books for bread)
We offer the possibilities to create a list to read books (books to read)

To list books that are already read

To give a small review and evaluation of a book (like 5 of 10 books)

The reviews are attached to the books itself

Create a profile

Have a personal database and manage that (CRUD)

Have a demo mode/fake account to show the whole functionality without sign up

Note for Search bar if there is not title (inside of Search bar component)

To suggest books to friends/ a friend with a button -> send a mail

Share button for social media


This application is created by creative team,
during the final modules of the studying process in
"Digital Career Institute" in Fullstack Web Development course
